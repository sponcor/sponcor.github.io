            <H4> "Arkansas? I forgot that was a state!" - You, probably. </H4>

                <P1> Yeah. Me too. I was raised in Arkansas from the age of seven until I moved here to Boulder for school. 
                    Though I did not move there willingly, it is where I called home for nearly 10 years. 
                    I lived in the Northwest corner of the state in the grand 'ol town of Bentonville.</p1>

                <P1> Recognize that town name? You've probably read a Walmart "Great Value" label or you're an avid mountain biker. </p1>

    <p1> <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas"> According to Wikipedia, </a> Arkansas (/ˈɑːrkənsɔː/ i AR-kən-saw[c]) is a landlocked state in the south-central region of the Southern United States.
            It is bordered by Missouri to the north, Tennessee and Mississippi to the east, Louisiana to the south, and Texas and Oklahoma to the west. 
            Its name is from the Osage language, a Dhegiha Siouan language, and referred to their relatives, the Quapaw people.
            The state's diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains, which make up the U.S. Interior Highlands, 
            to the densely forested land in the south known as the Arkansas Timberlands, to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River and the Arkansas Delta.
            
            <br>
            
            <br>

            Arkansas's culture is observable in museums, theaters, novels, television shows, restaurants, and athletic venues across the state. Notable people from the 
            state include politician and educational advocate William Fulbright; former president Bill Clinton, who also served as the 40th and 42nd governor of Arkansas; 
            general Wesley Clark, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander; Walmart founder and magnate Sam Walton;[13] singer-songwriters Johnny Cash, Charlie Rich, Jimmy Driftwood, 
            and Glen Campbell; actor-filmmaker Billy Bob Thornton; poet C. D. Wright; physicist William L. McMillan, a pioneer in superconductor research; poet laureate Maya Angelou; Douglas MacArthur; 
            musician Al Green; actor Alan Ladd; basketball player Scottie Pippen; singer Ne-Yo; Chelsea Clinton; actress Sheryl Underwood; and author John Grisham.

                <p1> IT. IS. PRONOUNCED. ARE-CAN-SAW. NOT. ARE-KANSAS. <strong>EVERYONE. HAS. MADE. THAT. JOKE.</strong>
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas"> Also according to Wikipedia, </a> The name Arkansas initially applied to the Arkansas River. It derives from a French term, Arcansas, their plural term for their transliteration of akansa, an 
                    Algonquian term for the Quapaw people. These were a Dhegiha Siouan-speaking people who settled in Arkansas around the 13th century. Kansa is likely also the root term for Kansas, 
                    which was named after the related Kaw people.

                <H4> Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art</H4>

                    <p1> A $390 million art museum containing nearly $2 billion of assets, this Bentonville art museum hosts famous works
                        from artists such as 
                        <br>
                        Georgia O'Keefe, Don Chihuly, Jean-Michele Basquiat, Yayoi Kusama, Keith Haring, and more.

                <H4> The Buffalo National River </H4>

                    <P1> Established in the early '70s, the Buffalo River is the first National River designated by the National Parks
                        Service. Characterized by giant, 300-foot, limestone bluffs, this river is probably half the reason as to why 
                        Arkansas is referred to as the <i> Natural State.</i>
                    </P1>

                <H4> The Walmart Museum</H4>

                    <P1>"Why would Arkansas have a museum dedicated to Walmart?" </P1>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <P1> Well, Walmart, the #1 Fortune 500 company, was started in Bentonville. The first location, originally called
                        "Walton's 5 & 10," was turned into a museum and ice cream shop. Surprisingly it has some of the best ice cream
                        in the town. 
                    </P1>
                
                <H4> The Crater of Diamonds State Park</H4>
                    
                    <p1>Crater of Diamonds, as coloquially referred by locals, is the State Park famous for being the only diamond mine in
                        the United States, and the only public diamond mine in the entire world (I do not have a citation for that but that is what I was taught in school). Families from around the country come to this 
                        public place in search for riches (though usually they only find bits of quartz). Every once in a while, I will see a story
                        on the local news about someone who has found a large diamond.
