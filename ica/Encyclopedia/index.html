    <H2> Overview </H2>
    

    <H4> "Arkansas? I forgot that was a state!" - You, probably. </H4>

    <P1> Yeah. Me too. I was raised in Arkansas from the age of seven until I moved here to Boulder for school. 
        Though I did not move there willingly, it is where I called home for nearly 10 years. I lived in the Northwest corner of the state in the grand 'ol town of Bentonville. Woo Pig.</p1>
